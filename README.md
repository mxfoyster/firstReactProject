## A simple timer component

As my first React project, I chose to make a simple Timer component. The project has it's own website (also in React) which explains the code and is hosted as a static site [HERE](https://first-react.markfoyster.co.uk/).

The timer component is created as an **ES6** Class style component and is self contained (Excluding css) as a module that makes for easy importing into other React components / projects.

Overall, it's my first React project, I've learnt a lot and have no regrets. There is still much room for improvement. I still have a lot to learn.

I'm loving the whole component centric style approach to React. It make it easier to create truly Abstract code that is easy to re-purpose later.

## Additional content

I have added a simple menu that separates the middle content into components allowing React to swap it out for a 'Multi Page' style website without a complete reload.

The pages include

- *Code Review* page that briefly discusses some of the concepts I have learnt through this project.

- *Other Stuff* page which for now imports and displays some data from a MySql database using an API from another project.
